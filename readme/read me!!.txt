Prerequisites:
Flex (The Fast Lexical Analyzer)
Bison (GNU Parser Generator)
GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) or another C compiler
Ensure these tools are installed and properly configured on your system.


now :
write your grammar for lexer in a text file with .l extension 
write your grammar for parser in a text file with .y extension
convert the lexer file into .c file by typing "flex yourfilename.l" in the command prompt
convert the parser file into .h and .c file and link the .h file with the .c file generated by flex 
use "gcc -o mycompiler parser.tab.c lex.yy.c" to compile the final exe file (your compiler) !
run the exe file from the terminal!!! 


NOTE: 
This process creates an executable .exe file, which is compatible with Windows and linux only.
